Look into making it so that you can simply initialize a class of PNG and WEBP
then hold which methods are converted into what using some variable.
Using this, have some code like:
bool convert(arg1, arg1) {

}


CAN USE ENUMS AS ERROR CODE
enum ERROR_CODE {
  SUCCESS,
  CONVERSION_ERROR,
  RETURN_ERROR
}

errorMSG(arg) {
  switch(arg) {
    case "...":
    etc.
  }
}
ERROR_CODE ec = doSomething();
std::cout << errorMSG[ec];
